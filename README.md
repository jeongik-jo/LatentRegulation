# LatentRegulation  
Official implementation of statistical distance latent regulation loss for latent code recovery.  
Edit HyperParameters.py, then run Run.py.  
There are already trained classifier and GAN in models directory, so you can just perform latent code recovery.  
Trained GAN is trained with normal distribution. 
If you want to experiment with other latent distributions, edit HyperParameters.py and run Run.py to train other GAN and perform latent code recovery.  
You can check environment in Environment.txt
